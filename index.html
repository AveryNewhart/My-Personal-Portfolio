        <p>My name is Avery Newhart and I'm 23 years old! I was born in the small town of Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania. After highschool, I went to Millersville University for a year before I ended up enlisting into the United States Air Force and did weather! I was stationed down south in Louisiana! Now I'm back to living in Pennsylvania and starting my new career! For fun I like to play video games, go on hikes, and watch sports!</p>
        <p>While in highschool, I had a few classes regarding coding apps and designing websites and that is where my initial interest started. Another thing in highschool was that I played various sports which helped me become more of a leader, and a better ability and understanding of how to work as a team. Upon graduating highschool, I decided to not pursue that field so I decided to go for a dual major in special and early childhood education. While there for only my freshman year, I joined the fraternity Tau Kappa Epsilon which helped with my overall networking, and communication skills. After my freshman year, I enlisted into the United States Air Force and became a weather forecaster for the whole southeast quarter of the United States. I would issue warnings, watches, and advisories for bases or point sites to safeguard billions of dollars in equipment. While being in the region that I was, we dealt with a high level of severe weather from tornadoes to hurricanes and during those events, I had to work under a very high stress environment which has no room for errors, furthering my strength in mental toughness and the ability to work in high stress environments.</p>
